Touch for Points

It is a very simple, two player action game which requires some fast reflexes. Random circles will appear on the screen in different colors.
Those will be:
* white
* brown
* red
* blue
* green
* black

You gain points when you tap a circle with the right color, but hold up! The right color changes. And in addition, the color that was active
before will do some random things if you tap it (e.g. gain double points, reset score, ...).

The circles disapear after a while. You can lose points by:
* pressing a wrong colored circle
* waiting to long and a circle with the right color disapears
* a rondom event that does some crazy stuff and loses you the game

The one with the highest score after 1 minute wins
